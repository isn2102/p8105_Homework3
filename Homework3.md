## Problem 1

Describe the data:

``` r
data("instacart")
```

The dataset instacart contains 1384617 observations and 15 columns.
Observations are at the level of items in orders placed by users. The
variables provide information about the users/orders and the items
purchased. For example aisle contains values such as “fresh vegetables”
and “eggs,” product\_name contains values such as “spring water” and
“organic half and half” and days\_since\_prior\_order is numeric. The
total list of variables is: order\_id, product\_id,
add\_to\_cart\_order, reordered, user\_id, eval\_set, order\_number,
order\_dow, order\_hour\_of\_day, days\_since\_prior\_order,
product\_name, aisle\_id, department\_id, aisle, department.

Count aisles:

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles, with most items ordered from the fresh fruits and
fresh vegetables aisles.

Make a plot of aisles:

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle), 
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="Homework3_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />
Most of the aisles with order counts above 10,000 show between 10k - 20k
orders. There are about 8 aisles with order counts between 20-40k, 3
aisles with order counts between 40-80k, and two aisles (fruit and
vegetables) with order counts around 150k.

Make a table of popular items:

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

The most popular items in baking are brown sugar, baking soda, and cane
sugar. The most popular items in dog food care are snack sticks, organix
chicken recipe, and small dog biscuits. The most popular items in
packaged fruits/veggies are baby spinach, raspberries, and blueberries.

Make a table for mean hour of product ordered on each day of the week:

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

Overall coffee ice cream is ordered a little later in the day on
weekdays (around 3pm), while pink lady apples are ordered a little
earlier in the day (around noon). On weekends both products on average
are ordered around 12pm.
